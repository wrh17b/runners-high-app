## Overview
### Description
Runner's High is a mood-tracking and run-tracking app that allows users to log their mood both before and after they go running. It also logs the user's run through location services and provides information on their pace and route. User will be able to look back at data from previous runs and see how their mood has changed over time.

### App Evaluation
